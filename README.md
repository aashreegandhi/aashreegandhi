Aashree Gandhi is an MA candidate in Clinical Psychology at Teachers College, Columbia University, a research volunteer for the PREDiCTOR Study, and a collaborator with the Multimodal Insights into Neuopsychiatric Disorders (MIND) Lab at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Her work with PREDiCTOR involves contributing to multimodal data collection, like administering the WAIS-V, and exploratory analyses to assess psychiatric functioning in young people. At Teachers College, she is developing a thesis project that examines lived experiences of neurodivergent adolescents, as well as a project studying depression and anxiety, integrating methods such as gaze behavior and risk-taking tasks to better understand individual differences in affective symptoms.

Aashree’s interest in developmental psychology and clinical science has been shaped by years of hands-on work with children, including long-term caregiving roles and experience in educational settings. These early experiences gave her firsthand insight into how young people learn, communicate, and regulate emotion—insights that later guided her toward neuropsychological assessment and research. She has administered standardized cognitive assessments with school-aged students using the Woodcock–Johnson, supported school-based testing, and completed training in clinical interviewing, developmental psychology, and neuropsychological assessment, all of which have strengthened her commitment to understanding behavior through a developmentally informed lens.

Across her academic and research training, she has developed a strong interest in objective measurement, early risk identification, and the use of AI-driven or computational methods to enhance clinical decision-making. Aashree is highly interested in neuropsychology and plans to pursue doctoral training in Clinical Psychology to continue investigating how multimodal behavioral data can inform more precise, developmentally grounded assessment and intervention in youth mental health.
